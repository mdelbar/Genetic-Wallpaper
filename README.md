Genetic-Wallpaper
=================

A genetic algorithm to generate smooth gradient wallpapers.
Disclaimer: 
- Generated wallpapers are not very smooth
- Code is not very performant (though as optimized as possible, but Java...)
- Many generations are needed to create something resembling smooth, which cripples performance for larger sizes than 100x100 pixels
- Not very interactive, change parameters in the Main class
